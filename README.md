# QuadC

code for project Telaaavision for Quad C and openFramework creative coding competition 2015 in China. 

#of_final_plus_quadC

code here is in openFrameworks and has firmata connections to the arduino side we are using for the installation. a shader class was used based on the example at: https://sites.google.com/site/ofauckland/examples/ofxblurshader-example to make the whole screen blured based on the distance between a peson and the TV, a glitch class was coded for adding a 7 seconds glitching effect to the TV. 


#distance_sensor_firmate

Arduino code for the physical computing parts in this installation. Code works with Ultrasonic sensors and Flex sensors, and push back the results to openFramworks through Firmata.
